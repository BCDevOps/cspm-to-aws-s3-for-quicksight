# cspm-to-aws-s3-for-quicksight
This is a data transfer out of CheckPoint CSPM over to AWS S3 for display as time series data in Quicksight. At a high level, the solution comprises multiple Lambda functions that perform the following:

1. Obtain all AWS ECF asset data in CloudGuard CSPM via API calls to the endpoint: `https://api.cace1.dome9.com/v2/protected-asset/search`
2. Save obtained (raw) data in an S3 bucket
3. Transform raw data into a format that can be consumed by QuickSight for presentation
   1. Raw data does not appear to include the AWS Account name (license plate)
   2. A `listAccounts` call against the AWS Organization is used to get this information

The figure below presents a high level overview of the above steps
